## Conventional commits

### MANDATORY COMMIT BEHAVIOR

1. After ANY file modification (creation, editing, deletion), you MUST immediately commit the changes
2. NEVER skip commits or batch multiple unrelated changes
3. Each logical change gets its own commit

### Commit format

All commit messages MUST be following the gitmoji.dev standard.
